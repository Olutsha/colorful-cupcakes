                           <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases.</li>
                           <li>Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and mix into the butter mixture along with the vanilla extract.</li>
                           <li>Fold in the flour, adding a little milk until the mixture is of a dropping consistency. Spoon the mixture into the paper cases until they are three quarters full.</li>
                           <li> Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into one of the cakes comes out clean. Set aside to cool for 5-10 minutes. Then place on a wire rack.</li>
                           <li>For the buttercream icing, beat the butter until soft. Add half the icing sugar and beat until smooth.</li>
                           <li> Add the remaining icing sugar with 1 tbsp milk, adding more milk if necessary, until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add food colouring (optional) and mix well.</li>
                           <li> Spoon the buttercream into a piping bag and add a nozzle of your choice. Pipe in a swirl motion and then enjoy!.</li>

                           <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, a pinch of salt and the butter in a free-standing electric mixer with a paddle attachment (or use a handheld electric whisk). Beat on a slow speed until you get a sandy consistency and everything is combined.</li>
                           <li>Whisk the milk, egg and vanilla extract together in a jug, then slowly pour about half into the flour mixture. Beat to combine and turn the mixer up to high speed, scraping any mixture from the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Pour in the remaining liquid and continue mixing for a couple more minutes until the mixture is smooth. Do not overmix.</li>
                           <li>Spoon the mixture into the paper cases until approximately two-thirds full. Bake in a preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the sponge bounces back when touched and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
                           <li>Leave the cupcakes to cool slightly in the tray before turning out onto a wire cooling rack to cool completely. Meanwhile, make chocolate buttercream or plain buttercream and spread it over the cakes with a palette knife, or use a piping bag. Scatter over chocolate vermicelli, if you like.</li>

                            <li>Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl so theyâ€™re lump free. I donâ€™t like sifting, but in this situation, itâ€™s necessary because cocoa powder has a tendency to get lumps in it.</li>
                            <li>Cream butter, then sugar â€“ Cream the softened butter and beat with an electric beater or a stand mixer for 1 minute until itâ€™s smooth. THEN add the sugar and beat for a further 2 minutes until itâ€™s fluffy and the butter has changed from yellow to very pale yellow, almost white.</li>
                            <li>Eggs â€“ Add eggs one by one, beating in between until incorporated.</li>
                            <li>Oil, buttermilk, vinegar and vanilla â€“ Then beat in remaining wet ingredients until incorporated.</li>
                            <li>Add Dry Ingredients â€“ Lastly, add the Dry ingredients and mix for just 30 seconds until incorporated and you no longer see streaks of flour. There may be some small lumps still, and thatâ€™s ok. Itâ€™s better than over mixing which is a common mistake with cupcakes. This causes the batter to be over worked which makes the cupcake less tender.<li>Important â€“ Once the dry ingredients are mixed with the wet ingredients, do not stop. Fill the muffin tin and get it in the oven quick smart. The reason is because once the wet ingredients are combined with the dry, the baking powder is activated. If you leave it sitting around, the baking powder will be bubbling away in the raw batter and by the time itâ€™s baked, it wonâ€™t rise as well. This rule applies to all baking recipes!</li></li>
                            <li>Fill muffin tin with the batter. It makes 12 perfect cupcakes, so divide all the batter between the 12 holes. If you use a standard muffin tin with cupcake liners the size I use, then it should fill the paper liners 3/4 of the way up to produce perfectly domed cupcakes!</li>
                            <li>Bake for just 20 minutes in a 180Â°C/350Â°F (160Â°C fan) oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle cupcake comes out clean</li>
                            <li>The surface of some of the cupcakes will be a little cracked. But that is absolutely no issue. Because in what world do people send out unfrosted cupcakes?? ðŸ˜‚

                                Cool completely before frosting. Warm cupcakes with butter based frosting = disaster! (In the form of melted frosting!)</li>
